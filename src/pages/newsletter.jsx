                    Virtual facilitation is a new challenge for a lot of us. To help you meet it head on, we developed this resource. <strong>If you want to be notified when new activities are added, join the newsletter be in the know as soon as they go live!</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We'll not only be posting new activities but also mini-agendas for a sequence of activities you can facilitate. If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll automatically get <a href="https://www.facilitator.cards/blog">our blog</a> in your inbox any week we post new content.                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "A stack" is our shorthand for a sequence of cards, or a seamless flow of processes. Each stack we share here will give you ideas for virtually facilitating a group from <Link to={`/for/emotion`}>emotion</Link> to <Link to={`/for/ideation`}>ideation</Link> to <Link to={`/for/clarification`}>clarification</Link> to <Link to={`/for/execution`}>execution</Link>. We'll include the step-by-steps of each activity, as well as pointers for transitioning through the stack.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If that all sounds like it's right up your alley, we'll see you in the newsletter. Oh! And don't forget: You can always reply directly to our emails to get ahold of us. We'd especially love to hear back if you're testing or tweaking the activities we publish.
                  </p>
